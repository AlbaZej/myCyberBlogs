# Zero to Signal

## Who I Am

I am a software developer with experience in **C#** and **Python**, primarily working on
internal tooling and automation.

This blog documents my **transition into reverse engineering** and low-level security —
starting from zero.

## Why This Exists

This site is part of my reverse engineering coursework.
Instead of retroactively faking experience, I chose to document my learning process
openly and honestly.

The goal is understanding, not performance.

## Focus Areas
- Reverse engineering fundamentals
- Tooling (Ghidra, debuggers)
- Mental model shifts from developer → reverse engineer
- Open questions and unknowns
